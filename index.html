                Hello, my name is Sergio Ontiveros. I was born  in Chicago, Illinois on March 27, 1994. Shortly after my family moved to Florida where my father's side of the family lived. When I was about 5 years old we decided to move back to Chicago where my moms side of the family lived.

                Some of my favorite sport to play is Soccer! i've been playing since I was the age of five. I managed to make my school team in highschool as well, which I'm proud of, as well as glad becuase that's how I managed to make most of my friends right off the bat. Other sports I also play are Volleyball, other than that other sport I do enjoy playing but just for fun.

                As far as my academic career, its still a work in progress. I am a soon to be CS major but I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp at Northwestern University. I hope to find a job in my career shortly after graduating from that and start gaining experience. The ultimate goal would be graduating with my bachelors from Lewis University. I have already started that, but I am taking a short break from it until i can finish my bootcamp at NW.
